Version: 1.1.1
Date: 2024.12.02
  Changes:
    - Added hi-res textures for Nauvis and Gleba. Thanks to artist "Valerian".
    - Added placeholder hi-res sprites for Aquilo, Fulgora, and Vulcanus. They are scaled up via AI tools.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.0
Date: 2024.12.02
  Changes:
    - Added planet parallax effect. (Can be disabled or customized in settings)
    - (Note that this is a WIP implementation. Parallax in multiplayer is functional but not great; See known issues on the mod page for more info.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.10
Date: 2024.12.01
  Changes:
    - Planet renders are now cleaned up when a platform is deleted.
    - Hopefully fixed a crash where a shrinking planet render becomes invalid. (Or is invalid and starts shrinking, couldn't reproduce.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.9
Date: 2024.12.01
  Changes:
    - Much nicer internal logic for planet animation. No change to functionality.
    - Added config options for planet position, spawn position, size and animation duration. More options coming soon. (Like non-linear animation)
    - Changed some default values for planet renders. Overall, default animation is slower, and planet is smaller than previous versions to help hide pixelation.
    - Fixed an issue where planet renders could become stuck if arriving at a planet within a few seconds of departing from the same planet.
    - Locale added, just settings for now.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.8
Date: 2024.12.01
  Changes:
    - Large planet sprites now render smaller, so that they aren't massive compared to base game planets.
    - (Small sprites are unaffected currently, and will still appear smaller than base planets.)
    - Removed .git files from mod upload. Sorry about that.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.7
Date: 2024.12.01
  Changes:
    - Planet icons now fetched automatically, so most planet mods should be supported now.
    - Due to new format, old planet renders are gone. Just toggle platform paused state to get a new one.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.6
Date: 2024.12.01
  Changes:
    - Fixed asteroid shadows appearing on planet render. (Thanks Thaui!)
    - Quick shuffle of mod files internally, shouldn't affect anything.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.5
Date: 2024.11.30
  Changes:
    - Removed 1.0 requirement for optional mods. (Some had version 0.x.x)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.4
Date: 2024.11.30
  Changes:
    - Added compatibility with multiple new planet mods. (See optional dependencies)
    - Massively reduced file size, as planet graphics are now retrieved from the respective mod/base game.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 1.0.2
Date: 2024.11.30
  Changes:
    - Planets now move and shrink/grow when arriving and departing orbits.
